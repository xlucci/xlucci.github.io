<p>I like identifying trends and common themes across different sets of data. Whether itâ€™s history or linguistics or even food -- how many noodle-type dishes can you name? -- finding patterns, especially across disciplines, is for me like uncovering the conspiracy of the world, or reading a book and finding that one of your favorite characters from another book has decided to make a cameo in it. I also like graphs and wild speculation -- there is no better way to spend an entire afternoon than discussing whether or not other people really exist.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I experiment with different methods of food preparation and challenge myself by adding dietary restrictions, e.g baking for vegans without flax seeds and/or other common egg substitutes. I also like hoarding information, and enjoy running short experiments and/or surveys about such exciting topics as the effects of preparation method and meat quality on the taste of steak. When punting work, I am often customizing my new Arch Linux installation or writing up blog posts for the <a href="http://random-hall.mit.edu/blog/">Random Hall blog</a>, which attempts to offer high school seniors and incoming freshmen insight into life at MIT. Occasionally I write silly Python scripts to let my computer do repetitive tasks for me. Currently I am thinking of ways to teach my computer to make music. <!--Currently, I am very slowly working on a survey to determine how accurately the average college student perceives the weight of a biologically female body. It seems that with the prevalence of Photoshop in the media nowadays our visual mappings of body to weight are skewed, and it would be interesting to see both in which direction perception is skewed and by how much.-->
<p>From late June until early August I will be at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), annotating English sentences with grammatical dependencies and helping to build a treebank for computational analysis. In August I will also be mentoring for Junction, one of the student-run programs under the Educational Studies Program (ESP) at MIT.</p>
